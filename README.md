# Booklovers Bookstore

![Books Page for Science Fiction](./src/img/science-fiction-page.jpg.png);

Booklovers bookstore is a generic online shopping application. It is built on React and React Router, tested using Jest and React Testing Library, and uses book and cover data from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/).

The application allows a user to search for books by subject or keyword, and navigate to a page displaying the results of their search and potentially add books to their cart. At any time, the user can navigate to their cart using a link in the navbar, to check the items they have added and view their calculated total cost.

This app was built as part of the curriculum at [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com), and generic project specs can be found at [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-shopping-cart].
